About project:

Introduction
We live in a world buzzing with new gadgets and fast fashion, but we're also facing growing piles of waste and worries about stable jobs. Reinnodross offers a hopeful path forward. It's designed to tackle both issues by creating a space where innovation meets sustainability head-on. Instead of just consuming and discarding, Reinnodross builds a bridge, connecting creators of the new with masters of reuse. This project explores the idea behind Reinnodross, checks if it makes sense in today's market, and looks at the real impact it could have.

Objectives
Here's what we want to figure out with this research:

Understand How It Works: Get a clear picture of the day-to-day operations of Reinnodross – how items get listed, sold, and managed on both Reinno and Dross.

Show the Good It Can Do: Explore the real-world benefits – how Reinnodross can help people earn a living, reduce landfill waste, and support communities.

Figure Out the Tech Needs: Identify the right technology to build a smooth, secure, and user-friendly platform for buyers and sellers.

Plan for the Future: Outline a smart strategy so Reinnodross can grow successfully and sustainably for the long haul.
